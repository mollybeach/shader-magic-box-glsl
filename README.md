Welcome to Shader Magic Box - your playground for creating characters with GLSL shaders!

## Overview

Shader Magic Box is a collection of GLSL shader programs designed to generate and manipulate characters in real-time. Whether you're creating stylized 2D sprites or detailed 3D models, this repository provides a foundation for experimenting with shader-based character creation.

## Features

- **Shader Templates:** Pre-built GLSL shaders for common character features like skin rendering, hair simulation, and clothing effects.
- **Customization:** Easily modify shader parameters to tweak character appearance such as color, texture, and lighting.
- **Real-time Preview:** See changes instantly with live updates in your rendering environment.
- **Cross-platform Compatibility:** Works on desktop and mobile platforms supporting OpenGL/GLSL.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- OpenGL-capable graphics hardware.
- GLSL-compatible development environment (e.g., OpenGL SDK, WebGL-enabled browser).

### Installation
